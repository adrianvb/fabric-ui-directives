# fabric-ui-directives

Welcome to this preliminary repository for Office Fabric UI Directives. This is by no means a representation of the final repository which can be found [here](https://github.com/ngOfficeUIFabric/ng-officeuifabric).

# How to set up
- Clone the repository
- Run NPM install to install all dependencies
- Run karma to start the unit test runner

# What editor to use?
- You can use any editor. I'm using Visual Studio with the [Karma TestAdapter](http://mortenhoustonludvigsen.github.io/KarmaTestAdapter/), but you are free to use any editor. I've excluded all Visual Studio files.

# Install via NuGet
Currently it's deployed to MyGet. You'll need to add my repo to be able to install it.
